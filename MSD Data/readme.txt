Drag and drop folders into your songs directory. 
If you renamed specific packs you will have to instead copy the group of songs folders into your renamed pack dir.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ****
I have renamed certain packs on my end (specifically packs that are members of a series e.g. "midare megapack 2"
instead of "midare and knoobish pack 2") so if data isn't showing up double check to make sure the data files are
actually in the pack folder.

If you renamed your songs folders, you are an idiot.
